      "title": "Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment",
      "summary": "The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.",

      "title": "UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling",
      "summary": "Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.",

      "summary": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to help Large Language Models (LLMs) to process tasks involving long documents. However, existing retrieval models are not designed for long document retrieval and fail to address several key challenges of long document retrieval, including context-awareness, causal dependence, and scope of retrieval. In this paper, we proposed AttentionRetriever, a novel long document retrieval model that leverages attention mechanism and entity-based retrieval to build context-aware embeddings for long document and determine the scope of retrieval. With extensive experiments, we found AttentionRetriever is able to outperform existing retrieval models on long document retrieval datasets by a large margin while remaining as efficient as dense retrieval models.",

      "title": "Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents",
      "summary": "Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.",

      "title": "Function-Space Decoupled Diffusion for Forward and Inverse Modeling in Carbon Capture and Storage",
      "summary": "Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.",

The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks. We prove universal approximation properties and establish the asymptotic $\\varepsilon$-optimality for the iUzawa-Net, and validate its promising numerical efficiency through nonsmooth elliptic and parabolic optimal control problems. Our techniques offer a versatile framework for designing and analyzing various optimization-informed deep learning approaches to optimal control and other PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed learning-to-control approach synergizes model-based optimization algorithms and data-driven deep learning techniques, inheriting the merits of both methodologies.",

      "title": "MonarchRT: Efficient Attention for Real-Time Video Generation",
      "summary": "Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.",

      "summary": "We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.",

      "summary": "Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is \"substantially similar\" to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been generated without that work in its training corpus. To operationalize this definition, we model generative systems as closure operators mapping a corpus of existing works to an output of new works. AI generated outputs are \\emph{permissible} if they do not infringe on any existing work according to our criterion. Our results characterize structural properties of permissible generation and reveal a sharp asymptotic dichotomy: when the process of organic creations is light-tailed, dependence on individual works eventually vanishes, so that regulation imposes no limits on AI generation; with heavy-tailed creations, regulation can be persistently constraining.",

      "title": "CM2: Reinforcement Learning with Checklist Rewards for Multi-Turn and Multi-Step Agentic Tool Use",
      "summary": "AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.
